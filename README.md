## 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine

**[Bradot Engine](https://bradotengine.org) is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.** It provides a comprehensive set of [common tools](https://bradotengine.org/features), so that users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can be exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop
platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as Web-based platforms and [*consoles](https://docs.bradotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/platform/consoles.html).

## Free, open source and community-driven

Bradot is completely free, open source and a fork of the Godot Engine under the very permissive [MIT license](https://bradotengine.org/license). No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down to the last line of engine code. Bradot's development is fully independent and
community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their expectations.

Before being open sourced in [February 2014](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/0b806ee0fc9097fa7bda7ac0109191c9c5e0a1ac), *Godot* had been developed by [Juan Linietsky](https://github.com/reduz) and [Ariel Manzur](https://github.com/punto-) (both still maintaining the project) for several years as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire titles.
